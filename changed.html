   Before, when we were just a kid, all we could think is just to play. But for me, this is not a simple play. 
   It is a play that makes our mind wonder with joy, freedom and imagination. Only we could think is to 
   imagine those things with enthusiastic and playfulness, there is no judgement on it because, we 
   are just a kid, even though the things that we imagine is so impossible to achieve and very
   outside of the box but still, we are full of happiness and contentment. Reminiscing those feelings
   are so freeing. It is a feeling of freedom, a freedom to express our trueself without limitations 
   and outside expectations.

<h3> Things have changed the way we see ourself... </h3>


 <h4>
  Things have changed the way we see ourself, when we were just a kid, we don't put to much pressure
 in our looks, we may get dirty and messy but we don't care about it, the only matter to us is, we are
 happy of what we are doing. We get messy, by playing outside with the mud trying to build something 
 that we could only imagine, but despite of it, we are still smiling. Always in our happy times and always
 in our happy place, because, we see ourself through the lens of our eyes, not the lens of others.

  <h4> Things have changed the way we express our emotions.... </h4>

<p>
 <h4>
  Things have changed the way we express our emotions. The way we express our happiness, gratefulness, 
  joyfulness even the way we express those negative feelings, the sadness, hate, fear, dissapointment and 
  all of the emotions that we've encountered. We were those kids that our emotions, were able to 
  express and communicate in our own unique way. When we feel bad over something, we can easily cry or shout
  even though the whole neighbor will hear us, we don't care, because what matter to us is to express those 
  emotions and acknowledge that moment of dissapointment. Even those happy and joyful moments we let the world
  knows. We jump, we smile, we giggle and we express the feeling of excitement. We acknowledge the 
  different emotion at that moment in time. And that, give us the freedom to accept our human nature.

  <h4> Things have changed the way we see our Dreams and Imagination... </h4>

<p>
 <h4>
  Things have changed the way we see our dreams and imagination. We were those kids that always happy when we
 imagine those dreams, imagining and feeling it so vividly that we think it is already in front of us. We were
 those kids that our dreams are so outside the box, but still, we don't fear it if it will not come true, because,
 what matter to us is we are happy and excited when we imagine those big dreams. We were those kids, doing something
 that is unknown but full of curiosity and courage. Our curiosity lead us to think creatively and learning new things.
 Even though, things have changed since then, we are still that kid deep down in our heart, we still have the feeling of joyfulness
 and happiness. We still have the negative emotions that we need to acknowledge. We still have those imaginations and dreams
 that that are waiting for us to make it real. We still have the courage and curiosity to conquer the
 things that is new to us.

<p>
 All of the sudden we realize, all the things that we thought have gone or change, haven't change that much. It is there all
 along we've just kinda drifted apart for the things that we were used to. Our perspective shift drastically that we almost
 forgot the things that shape us today and the things that help us our journey up until now. We drifted apart from our childhood memories,
 that we unconsciously abandon it in the process. Going back to our childhood memories is realizing that, it is there all the time, asking
 for our recognition and acceptance so that we can connect again to our trueself. Connecting to our base and foundation with compassion and love.

Celebrate it! Peace and Lot's of love...
